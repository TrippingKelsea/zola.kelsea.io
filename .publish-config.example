# Obsidian to Zola Publishing Configuration
# Copy this file to .publish-config and customize for your setup
#
# For flat vault structure (no subdirectories except attachments)

# Path to your Obsidian vault
VAULT_PATH="$HOME/Documents/Obsidian/Notes"

# Path to your Zola site (usually current directory)
ZOLA_PATH="."

# Publish script location
SCRIPT_PATH="scripts/publish.py"

# Note: With flat vault structure, the script scans all .md files in the
# vault root and uses frontmatter to determine content type:
#
# Blog posts: No special fields, or type: "blog"
# Book chapters: Has weight/chapter_number, or type: "book"
#
# Control publishing with publish: true/false in frontmatter
