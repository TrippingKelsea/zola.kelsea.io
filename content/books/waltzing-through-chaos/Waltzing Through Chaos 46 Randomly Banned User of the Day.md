# Randomly Banned User of the Day

This is, perhaps, the origin of my infatuation with *breaking things professionally*.

I was working at NeXeT running tech support while studying, building, and tinkering constantly.

The graveyard shift was my playground.  
Quiet. Undisturbed.  
The few calls we did get were usually dumb.

> “I broke the cup holder in my PC,” one caller said.  
> (It was the CD-ROM tray.)

That job taught me how to be cordial to people—while loathing them completely.

And in that hatred for the stupid customers… I found inspiration.

---

Joel was working opposite me that night.

> “What if I made a tool that kicked people off,” I said. “Just to fuck with them.”

He laughed.

> “Like ban them from the internet?”

> “Exactly!”

> “I’ll call it… *No Internet For You!*”  
> (Said in a bad Seinfeld-Soup-Nazi accent.)

> “Nah,” Joel said. “Not catchy. Plus, you’ll get in trouble.”

Hmm.  
I shelved the idea.

---

A month or two later, I was on a different rotation, training a new hire Jake.
A couple friends of mine were heading west for a summer road trip.

I wanted to go.  
No gas money.

I explained this to Jake. He was a few years older than me and chuckled:

> “Just get fired. You’ll get unemployment. It’s like a paid vacation.”

*Cool.* Get fired. What could I do?

Oh, right.  
*No Internet For You.*

I explained the idea again.  
We both agreed—yeah, that’d probably get me fired.

So I built it.

---

I wrote a Perl script to manipulate RADIUS, the authentication system for dial-up modems.

Then I hooked it into our ColdFusion-based website.  
Glued on a code generator to auto-generate the changes.

Perfect.

I called it:  
**Randomly Banned User of the Day.**

I even had it update Remedy, our tech support ticket system, with instructions for whoever answered the call.

> “Huh. That was… unexpected.”

---

I fielded the first call myself when I launched it.

> “Sorry, John Smith. You’ve been randomly selected to not receive service today.  
> There’s an internet shortage, and not enough to go around.  
> So you’re out.”

*Click.*

He called back.

Another support rep got him.  
While they were reading the Remedy script aloud, *another* John Smith called in.

Wait, what?

I told my coworker to put the phone on hold.

I *also* had a John Smith on the line.

Different voice.  
Different caller ID.

A *third* call hit the switchboard.  
Another John Smith.

What?

---

News reached Edgar and Sharon pretty quick, they ran the company.

Edgar called me into his office.

He turned his monitor toward me.  
On the company website, wrapped in a `<blink>` tag:

> **Today’s Randomly Banned User of the Day is… John Smith!**  
> *Fuck John Smith. No internet for you!*

> “You did this?” Edgar asked. Voice flat.

Yeah.

> “Why?”

Honestly?

> “Yeah. Honestly.”

I told him the truth.

> “I wanted to get fired so I could get unemployment and go on a road trip with my friends.”

He chuckled.

> “You don’t get unemployment for being fired.”

> “Oh. That’s not what—”

> “Not important,” he cut me off.  
> “If you want time off, just ask.”

> “We can’t put this on the website, you know that, right?”

I nodded.

> “Good. Make it internal.  
> I want to find out how many of our customers are sharing passwords.  
> You’re in charge of it now.  
> Find out how much money we’re losing.”

I nodded again.

> “So… about the time off?”

> “Talk to Sharon. And your new title.  
> This is a good find.  
> You’re getting a promotion.”

---

I didn’t get to go on the road trip.  
But I *did* get a $15K raise and a promotion to **Lead Engineer**.

> *Fuck yeah.*
