# I Need You to Pick Up Your Father

Sometimes in life, you get asked to do hard things—for a good cause.  
And sometimes you get asked to do hard things that, well, hurt others.

This is one of those stories.

I was at home. On my computer, as usual. Always on my computer.  
The phone rang, knocking me off the BBS I was dialed into. Caller ID said it was Mom, so I answered.

> “Are you home?”

Duh, you called home and I answered.

> “I need you to go pick up your father.”

Why?

> “We don’t have time for questions. He was in an accident and was injured. You’re closer. I need you to go get him. Now.”

The tone of her voice rang sharp on the inflection of *now*.

> “I need you to get him before the police show up. He’s at the crossroads.”

I knew where that was—just a few miles down the road.

> “Drive fast.”

She hung up.

I grabbed my keys to the family station wagon.  
It was a 1980-something Pontiac Parisienne, cream with wood paneling.  
My friends and I had nicknames for it—everything from *Dragon Wagon* (a reference to our school) to *The Grocery Getter*.

It was a real piece of shit. Long past its expiration date. Dented and dinged.  
It ran on pure desperation instead of gasoline—which we often couldn’t afford.

I tore down the dirt road we lived on, my usual MO, and whipped a right onto the paved road at the end.

That thing would do zero to sixty in about thirty seconds, despite having a big block V8 in it.  
Like I said—it was a real piece of shit.

As I approached the crossroads, I saw the old man—walking toward me, blood running down his face.  
The car stopped just as well as it accelerated, and I spun it around in the middle of the street.  
I was practicing my J-turns—something I’d seen in a movie recently.

Dad poured himself into the back seat, laying across it.

> “What the fuck are *you* doing here? I called your mother.”

The stench of cheap whiskey and cigarettes filled the car as he spoke.  
I hit the gas.

> “She called me.”

> “You’re a real piece of shit,” he said as he passed out.

No thanks. No acknowledgment that I was doing him a favor.

I didn’t see his car. He must have walked a bit.

As I got the station wagon up to the speed limit, a couple of cops passed us heading toward the scene of the accident.  
A blue state trooper sedan, followed by a brown county cruiser. Both with their lights on.

I got Dad home. Mom was there when I arrived.

> “Better to have a ticket for leaving the scene,” she told me,  
> “than another DUI. One more and your father will lose his license permanently—and won’t be able to work. Then what would we do for money?”

Whatever.

I went back to my computer.

It was weeks later when I found out the real story.

> “What the fuck was I just an accessory to?” I asked my mother,  
> showing her the article in the paper about the hit-and-run where someone was near-fatally injured.

> “You’re a minor. They wouldn’t have been able to charge you.”

That was her fucking answer.

I was a minor.  
That’s why she asked me to go. To do her fucking dirty work.

Because I was a minor.

**What the fuck.**

Dad ended up spending several weekends in jail.  
He didn’t get a DUI. He didn’t even get in trouble for the hit-and-run part.  
Mom pleaded he was in a fugue state from the head injury.  
That he wasn’t even aware he’d been in an accident.

Reckless driving. A fine. A few weekends in jail.

He ruined someone else’s life—and that was it.

And I unknowingly helped.

**What the fuck.**
