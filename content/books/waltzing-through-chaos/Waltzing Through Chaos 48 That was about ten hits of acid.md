# That Was About Ten Hits of Acid

It was my first acid trip.

I was at a party being thrown by one of my college friends, Aree.

Skeet brought some LSD, among other delightful drugs.

This wasn’t cut onto tabs.  
Nope.  

There was a mutual friend who was chemistry major at UVA, and she hooked him up with pharmaceutical-grade, *pure uncut LSD*. Later I even got to help her make a batch and learn the process.

We used an eyedropper to place it on sugar cubes.

Except… I missed the part where it was supposed to be *one drop per cube*.

I pulled somewhere between 1 and 2 milliliters into the dropper—  
And squeezed it *all* onto my sugar cube.

Down it went.  
Dissolving on my tongue.

Gabby caught it, but she wasn’t fast enough to stop me.

She looked at me and said:

> “That was about ten hits.  
> Buckle up, baby. You’re going for a ride.”

She was right.

It lasted a few *blurry* days.  
I had no idea what was real and what wasn’t.

I could *see* music.  
Sounds became colors.  
Colors became shapes.  
Shapes had *tastes*.

It was absolutely fantastic.

I remember absolutely losing myself to the music around me. I remember feeling like I could just move and flow and exist, there was no pain only color and sound.

I don't quite know when the drugs finally wore off, or honestly if the every did sometimes, I just remember after about a week the days started to feel heavier. Thankfully that feeling didn't last too long, and soon I was pretty much taking 5-7 hits of acid every weekend.
