# Something Changed

Shortly after my sister was born, we moved in with my grandparents.  
Not *to* their house—but into a new house, together.

It was about the same size as the house my parents had before,  
but much, much smaller than the house my grandparents used to have.

I remember it didn’t have a pool.  
My grandparents’ old house had a pool.  

I didn’t know why we were moving in together.  
I didn’t know why we had to move out of our house.  
We just had to move.  

And I knew it was because something was wrong.

The house we moved into had three bedrooms.  
My sister and I shared one.  
But that was okay—she was a baby.

Our room was on the other side of the wall from the living room.  
I remember the nights my parents would send me to bed,  
and I could hear the TV on the other side of the wall.  

It was always something stupid, like *Johnny Carson*.

I would bang on the wall.  
They wanted me to sleep, after all.  
But I couldn’t, not with all the noise.

That would usually get me yelled at.  
Sometimes it would get me spanked.

I don’t know how long we lived in that house,  
but it was the first in a series of homes that we would share with my grandparents.

Years later, I asked:  
Why did we have to move in together back then?

I never got a real answer.

My mother would tell me things like:  
“Boompa’s business got stolen from him,”  
or  
“He was betrayed by a partner.”  

One time, she said it was because of the mob.  
I don’t know if any of that was true.

I do remember not liking sharing a room with my sister.  
She cried a lot—kept me awake most nights.

Mom or Dad would be in and out of the room all the time.  
That was annoying too.

I also remember everyone was fighting, all the time.  

Boompa would yell at Granny.  
Mom would yell at Dad.  
Granny would yell at Mom and tell *him* not to yell at Dad.  

Granny liked Dad more than Mom,  
even though she was Mom’s mom.

They would drink and smoke together.
