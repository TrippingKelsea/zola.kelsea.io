# Context

Context is one of my favorite words.  
Context is how we interpret things—feelings, sessions.  
Context is how we switch between thoughts, threads, conversations.  
It is fundamental to how we understand what is presented to us in life.

So to you, the reader, I want to set a very explicit context:  
In some parts of this book, names have been changed to protect the identities of both the guilty and the innocent.

And now, some poetry.

In my present today, there are several wars waging in the world.  
There is an election on the horizon in my country,  
a former president on trial in a country growing, growing and dividing.  

In my present day, I am also growing.  
I too, have been cleaved and divided.  

Anxiety and depression are my bad mental habits.  
Death by a thousand paper cuts, from what was surely a bad habit.  

Doth the lady protest…  
I wish it had been by me.

We end with this self-referenced engineer.this’s prayer:

```bash
cat <<EOF | sed -e 's/(:\w+degree)/$1, oh and also secure/' | sed -e 's/three/four/'
Dear Flying Spaghetti Monster, protect my widget, the infrastructure it depends on, the purpose it serves.

Protect it from it breaking, in the moments it is fragile.  
When it does break, forgive our transgressions, and make our widget whole.  

Should it be passed its weakest dependency’s end-of-life,  
make it upgradable, maintainable, seen as dependable to a measurable degree.
