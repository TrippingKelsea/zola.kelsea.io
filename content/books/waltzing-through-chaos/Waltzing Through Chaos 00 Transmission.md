**oh hai!**

this is *my* book, so i’m basically doing whatever the fuck i want with the english language.  
that includes not capitolizing words and occasionally misspelling things.  
some things are intentionally misspelled to preserve direct quotes.  
some things are intionally misspelled to fuck with you, *deer* reader.
