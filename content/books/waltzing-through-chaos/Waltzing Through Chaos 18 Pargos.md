# Pargos

We had moved into this subdivision called Peacock Hills.  
It wasn’t terribly far from the house we had just been living in, and it was quite a bit nicer.

Next door to us were the Carvers—Rob and Tiffany.  
Tiffany had a kid from a previous marriage, **Kevin**.  
She and Rob also had a child together.  
Kevin was just a year or so younger than I was.  
The other kid was little more than a toddler.

Rob was rich.  
He owned a restaurant chain called *Pargos*.  
It was like an Applebee’s, but for Greek food.  
They did a fried ice cream thing if it was your birthday—  
and I got to go there once.

Boompa had gotten back into trying to be a real estate agent,  
and had sold Rob the house in Peacock Hills.

Tiffany was a former model.  
She was still really good looking—at least to a young tween.  
Blonde, tall, thin—  
and Mom said her boobs were fake.

She smoked Virginia Slims constantly.  
Drank constantly.  
And she had a white BMW convertible.

Kevin and I would hang out a lot.  
He had just about every video game and game system a kid could want.  
And he had his own TV in his room—  
bigger than the one we had in our living room.

I remember countless hours and sleepovers playing *Zelda* on his NES.  
And ogling his mother.

The dining room of our house had a window  
that looked into the kitchen of their house,  
and Tiffany would walk around naked at night.

I stole the binoculars from Boompa’s closet  
and would watch her walking around the house naked.  
Whenever Rob was away on business,  
other guys would come over to their house.  
More than once I caught sight of them having sex with her in the kitchen.

One night, I was having a sleepover at Kevin’s.

Sometime during the night, I got up to pee  
and went down to the kitchen to grab a midnight snack.  
Tiffany was passed out on the couch in the living room—  
more than half-naked.

I stared at her for several minutes, taking in the full sight.  
Things I had only seen in magazines.

As I turned to go back to Kevin’s room,  
she shifted slightly, making a noise—  
and then asked me if I liked what I saw.

I was startled.  
I thought she was deeply asleep.

I simply nodded in the affirmative.  
I didn’t know how to respond.

*"Do you want a closer look?"* she asked me.

I took a step closer to her.

*"Closer,"* she said.  
*"Help me to my bedroom,"* she added, stretching out her arm.

I stepped closer and took her outstretched hand.  
Instead of pulling her up, she pulled me down.  
She pulled my face toward her breasts.

Her nipples were so tall—nothing like I’d seen in any of the magazines.  
I started sucking on one of them,  
and she pushed my hand down between her legs.

I wasn’t expecting the slickness I felt.  
I didn’t know what to expect—  
but it wasn’t that.

She had a tight grip on my hand,  
using it to rub herself.  
She was moaning,  
her other hand keeping my head firmly in place on her breast.

I was in an awkward and uncomfortable position—  
half on, half off the couch, lying on her.

Faster and faster, she used my hand—  
my fingers slipping in and out of her,  
her moans growing louder,  
her body convulsing.

Then she stopped.  
Pulled my head up by my hair.

*"Take your pants off and fuck me,"* she said.

I didn’t need to be told twice.

I had barely entered her  
when I experienced my own orgasm.

She laughed.  
*"You're just like my husband.  
He’s not a real man either."*

I didn’t say anything.  
I just grabbed my underwear  
and retreated back to Kevin’s room.

As I crawled into bed,  
he popped his head up from his own.

*"I watched you fuck my mom,"* he said.  
*"It was hot."*
