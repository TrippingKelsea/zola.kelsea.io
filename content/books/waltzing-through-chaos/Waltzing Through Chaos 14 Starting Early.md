# Starting Early

I didn’t<!-- BROKEN LINK: [I didn’t](I didn’t) --> set out to create a game.  
I was just learning.

I was learning about computers,  
playing around on the `Apple ]` we bought at the flea market.  
Learning about physics—Stephen Hawking’s book about black holes  
was in my backpack.

I was learning new words, and what they meant.  
Playing around with what a thousand `GOTO` statements  
and some user input logic could do.

**Spaghettification<!-- BROKEN LINK: [Spaghettification](Spaghettification) -->** was the new word of the day—

When I started the fourth grade that year,  
the classroom also had an Apple.  
So I made a copy of the disk and brought it to school,  
letting other classmates play with it.

One of the teachers saw it  
and encouraged me to post it on the network between schools.  
The school network was called *Prodigy* at the time,  
which later became *Prodigy Internet* as it grew.

They—*Prodigy*—ended up reaching out to the school,  
who connected them to my parents.  
They wanted to license the game from me  
so they could incorporate it into their small playable game library.

I never knew the details of the deal.  <!-- BROKEN LINK: [I never knew the details of the deal.  ](I never knew the details of the deal.  ) -->
And aside from being allowed to buy a new 286 Tandy computer,  
I never directly saw any of the money.

It all went to my parents.
