# The Extraction

I was fifteen or sixteen when the tooth pain started. I think I complained a lot—every day for a while, maybe.

My mother’s response was dismissive. *Brush your teeth more,* *your mouth looks yellow,* and other variations of not listening. She didn’t hear me. My fucking mouth hurt.

Eventually, I got dragged to the dentist for a routine checkup. He looked in my mouth—no cavities. I was good at brushing most days.

My wisdom teeth hadn’t yet come in, and he thought that might be the problem. He ordered an X-ray to see what was going on under the surface.

> “Your wisdom teeth are impacted,” he said, pointing to the X-ray film held up on the lightbox.

Even my untrained eyes caught it—those teeth were sideways. A real one-of-these-things-is-not-like-the-other moment.

> “All four of them,” he continued, shifting my gaze to the next piece of film.

He gave my mother a referral to an oral surgeon. This was out of his capabilities.

It was several weeks later when I found myself in the oral surgeon’s office to take care of the problem.

I was taken back to the surgical suite. I made it clear I didn’t like needles. One nurse distracted me while another slipped in an IV.

The anesthesiologist came in a few moments later and explained the drugs he was going to give me. I don’t recall the exact cocktail—sodium pentothal was in there, though, and I remember joking about it being truth serum.

> “Just lay back, and in a few moments you’ll drift off,” he said before leaving the room.

I’m not sure how long passed. Five minutes, maybe? Ten?

The surgeon and anesthesiologist came back in.

> “Oh, you’re still awake,” the surgeon said—some mix of surprise and disbelief in his voice.

> “Okay, I’m going to put something else in your IV,” said the anesthesiologist.

I felt the difference—the tingle as it moved through my arm.

> “Can you count down from 100 for me?”

“Ninety-nine…  
Ninety-eight…  
Ninety-seven…  
…  
Eighty-nine—”

> “Okay, this isn’t working,” he cut me off. “I’m going to give you a bit more of the first set of drugs. Just relax—we’ll be back in a few minutes.”

I was floating. It felt nice.

They came back in.

> “Okay, we’re going to use something different. We usually use this as a horse tranquilizer,” he said—half-joking, but serious.

> “Let’s start that countdown again.”

“Ninety-ni—”

I was out.

It was a while later. My eyes were crusty, and I didn’t move. The lights were dim. I wasn’t in the surgical room anymore. That had been bright, with big floor-to-ceiling windows looking out over the Blue Ridge Mountains.

This must be the recovery room, I reasoned. I knew I’d be brought here after surgery, but I hadn’t seen it before.

I could make out my mother a dozen or so feet away. My eyes were starting to adjust. I came to. I knew exactly what to say…

> “Fhuuu…”

It was a sound, not a word. My tongue felt huge in my mouth—like sandpaper. I closed my lips and tried to get some saliva going.

> “Fuuuck,” I groaned.

Better. Not what I was trying to say, but I had more.

The nurse turned to me, bringing a cup to my lips.

> “Just take this in. Don’t swallow it—let it sit for a moment, then spit it out.”

I did as she said. The doctor and my mother closed the distance from where they had been to the bed I was laying on.

I could move my tongue now. My mouth was still dry, but not painfully so.

> “Fuck, doc… that was better than heroin. Can I have some more?”

My mother nearly hit the ground.

I spent the next several days in bed. My mom kept pumping me full of Percocet despite me saying I didn’t want it.

> “You want to act like a drug addict,” she would say, “then I’m going to treat you like one.”

I’m not sure how much Percocet she gave me. I kept losing time.

I remember sitting up and starting to watch *The Price Is Right* one morning… and the next thing I remembered, it was dark outside.

It was about four days later when we must have run out—and I started to sober up.

I went back to the dorms to hang out with Angie and the others. They took care of me through the withdrawal symptoms.

It fucking sucked.
