# It Snowed in Hell

Living in Houston as a child, it was always hot.  
I was comfortable with that. Loved it.

One of the earliest memories I have—one of the *good<!-- BROKEN LINK: [good](good) -->* memories, one of the *happy* memories—was the year it snowed there.  

It was glorious.  
The first time<!-- BROKEN LINK: [time](time) --> I had ever [seen snow](seen snow).  

I think my sister had just been born.

My maternal grandfather—we called him **Boompa**—took me outside to play in it,  
in front of their mansion in Walkwood.

We built a small snowman.  
It sat on the trunk of his car—his black Cadillac Fleetwood with black leather interior.  
He had a Trans Am with an eagle on the hood, a truck, and a Porsche 944 as well.  
I never knew why he needed so many cars,  
but they all had car phones, and he would take me driving in them.

I slammed my finger in the truck door, I remember.  
It made my finger turn purple for a day or two, and it really hurt.

I recall my mother being so upset at me.  
*How could I be so careless?* she kept asking me.
