# I Deserved it
*And Other Lies I Used to Tell Myself*

My father was an alcoholic.  
It’s an easy thing to say, but it doesn’t really convey the uniqueness of any individual experience.

I remember my first actual driving lesson.

I’d already been mowing the grass on our Craftsman riding mower for a while,  
so I understood the basics—turn the wheel, push the pedal.  
But I’d never been behind the wheel of a real car.

His car was a shitty 1980-something Honda Civic hatchback.  
Primer grey, 4-speed transmission.  
It reeked of Merit cigarettes—  
butts scattered on the floor, ashtray overflowing.

> "This is how you hold your scotch while you drive,"  
> he said, placing a lowball glass between his legs.  
> It was full when we got in the car,  
> now just a few sips lower.

I didn’t always recognize the abuse  
when it was happening,  
or when it was about to get worse.

> "Ease out on the clutch.  
> When you feel the car start to move,  
> let go of the brake and hit the gas."

I followed the steps.  
The car lurched forward, sputtered, and stalled.  
The jolt caused his drink to splash.

His backhand landed hard—  
my ear exploded in pain.

> "Spill my drink again and you’ll be sorry.  
> Now do what I said—  
> find the friction point, then give it gas."

This wasn’t like the mower.

I restarted the engine,  
hand on the clutch, foot ready on the gas.  
This time I used the handbrake instead of the foot brake.  
Revved the engine up,  
released the clutch—

The car screeched, tires spinning gravel,  
and I slammed the brakes.

The pain came twice as hard this time:  
right side from his fist,  
left from where my head hit the window and frame.

> "Don’t fuckin’ burn out my clutch,"  
> he growled.

The car stalled again.  
His drink splashed again.  
And again the blows came.

> "I told you not to fuckin’ spill my drink."

I got out of the car.

> "I’ll get mom to teach me."
