# Thundercats Rule

I have very few memories of my friends from elementary school in Houston.  
I remember, vaguely, the school—it was Wilcrest Elementary, and we were the Wilcrest Wildcats, or something like that.

This was first or second grade, maybe.

One of the closest friends I had there was Josie.  I only remember her because every day, she would trade me her chocolate milk.

One of the playground games several of us played together was *Thundercats*, after the cartoon that was popular at the time.

I would always be **Cheetara**—or at least I *think* that was her name.

I didn’t have to be Cheetara. I *wanted* to be.  I got to pick.  I could have been Lion-O if I wanted, or one of the others.

Josie would play **Snarf**.  She didn’t care that I picked the only girl character from the cartoon.

I don’t know if I chose her because she was a girl.  She was a cheetah—and fast.  
I remember *that* was a reason.

She also stayed back from fights.  
She came in to protect the group while Lion-O did his sword-*make-me-grow-up* thing.

She had a bo—a fighting stick—instead of a sword like all the others.  
I liked that too.  

I had the prop sword of Lion-O at home.  
The one where the center jewel would light up if you squeezed the handle,  
and it could extend just like in the show.

In retrospect, she was a protector.  
Maybe I latched onto that as well.

My friends never questioned it.  
My parents never got it.  

I was the girl Thundercat.  
I was **Cheetara**.
