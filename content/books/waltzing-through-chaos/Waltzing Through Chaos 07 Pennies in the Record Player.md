# Pennies in the Record Player

I was naturally drawn to breaking things as a child.  
Not in the obvious ways—it was curiosity.  
I didn’t really even think about it.  
It was just something I did.

Dad had this stereo system in the living room.  
I remember playing with it: dropping the needle onto records,  
making cool sounds by speeding them up, slowing them down,  
and knocking the needle across the surface.

If I had known what DJ’ing was at that age—maybe four or so—  
I think I would have gravitated toward that.

My curiosity didn’t stop there.  
Every toy I ever got as a child would eventually find itself being dissected by me.  
Just for fun.  
I wanted to see how things worked.

Putting them back together… that was a different story.  
Most of the time, I just didn’t care to.  
When I did, it was a 50/50 chance it would work again.
