# About Kelsea

## $ whoami

I'm a software engineer, technical leader, and storyteller navigating the intersection of technology, identity, and human connection.

## Technical Journey

I've been building things with code since I was nine years old—my first licensed video game shipped before I hit double digits. By seventh grade, I was already exploring the boundaries of school systems (the digital kind). From building ISP infrastructure as a teenager to leading engineering teams today, technology has been my constant companion and creative outlet.

My professional work spans cloud architecture, infrastructure, and the kind of complex technical challenges that keep teams up at night (and me energized). I believe in writing code that serves people, building systems that scale with empathy, and fostering engineering cultures where everyone can thrive.

## Writing & Storytelling

Beyond the terminal, I'm writing my memoir—**Waltzing Through Chaos**—a raw and unflinching exploration of the first 25 years of my life. It's a story about survival, identity, defiance, and finding joy in unexpected places. Dark humor included.

I write about technology, life experiences, and the messy beautiful reality of being human in this industry. Sometimes all three at once.

## Values

**Authenticity matters.** I show up as my full self—trans woman, neurodivergent (ADHD/ASD), technologist, and human navigating this world one day at a time.

**Community is everything.** United we stand, divided we fall. I believe in standing with people, fighting for each other, and creating spaces where everyone belongs.

**Never stop breathing. Always come back safely.** Lessons from scuba diving that apply to life, work, and everything in between.

## When I'm Not Coding

You'll find me:
- 🤿 Scuba diving (living by those two essential rules)
- 🎮 Gaming (Balatro is currently consuming my life)
- 🎲 Playing board games with my queer family
- ✈️ Traveling (though airports and I have a complicated relationship)
- 💚 Spending time with the people who remind me that I'm not alone

## Connect

I'm always happy to chat about:
- Technology and engineering leadership
