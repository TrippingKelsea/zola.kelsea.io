## $ ls -la ~/projects/

A collection of things I've built, contributed to, or am actively working on.

## 📚 Waltzing Through Chaos

**Status:** In Progress | **Type:** Memoir

My autobiography—raw, unflinching, and deliberately irreverent. The first 25 years of my life told through the lens of survival, identity, and dark humor.

Topics: childhood trauma, gender identity, neurodivergence, technical prodigy, car crashes, FBI investigations, and finding joy in chaos.

[Read the chapters](/books/waltzing-through-chaos) as I write them.

## 💻 Open Source & Technical Work

Throughout my career, I've contributed to various open source projects and built infrastructure that scales. While much of my professional work is proprietary, I believe in giving back to the community that taught me so much.

**Areas of expertise:**
- Cloud architecture (AWS, distributed systems)
- Infrastructure as code
- Engineering leadership and team building
- Developer experience and tooling

## 🎮 The First One

**Year:** 1994 | **Type:** Video Game

My first licensed video game, shipped at age nine. A formative experience that taught me about creating things people actually use—and that code can be magic when it works.

Details lost to time (and a childhood that didn't prioritize documentation), but the lessons stuck.

## 🛠️ This Site

**Type:** Personal Blog & Portfolio | **Tech:** Zola, Terminal Theme

Built with a retro-terminal aesthetic because sometimes the best interfaces are the ones that remind us where we came from. Green-on-black CRT effects included.

Features:
- Custom terminal-inspired theme
- Dynamic book section for ongoing memoir
- Automated publishing from Obsidian vault
- Link validation and content diffing
- Multi-blog support with site filtering

[Source code](https://github.com) coming soon.

## 🚀 Future Projects

Ideas brewing, code fermenting:

- **Engineering blog series** on building inclusive tech teams
- **Technical deep dives** on distributed systems and cloud architecture
- **Writing tools** for authors who think in markdown
- **Something with scuba diving data** (because why not combine passions?)

## Want to Collaborate?

I'm always interested in:
- Projects that make technology more accessible
- Tools that help people tell their stories
- Initiatives that support underrepresented folks in tech
- Anything that combines technical depth with human impact

**Note:** This page is a living document. Projects come and go, ideas evolve, and sometimes the best work is the stuff we haven't built yet.
